# tqix
 >>> tqix: a Toolbox for Quantum in X:\
 >>>    X: quantum measurement, quantum metrology, quantum tomography, and others.

# Description
 >>> tqix is an open-source software providing some convenient tools 
     for quantum measurement, quantum metrology, quantum tomography, and others.
>>>In version 2.0.1 we add a library called tqix.pis for large-scale quantum simulation.     

>>> In version 3.0.* we add a library called tqix.vqa for Variational Quantum Algorithms
>>> In 4.1 we remove tqix.vqa
